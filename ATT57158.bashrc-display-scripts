# When evince and other graphical displays don't work, it's often because the
# DISPLAY environment variable inside tmux isn't the same as the one outside
# tmux.
#
# 1. Detach from tmux session and use cache_display
# 2. Reattach to tmux session and use parse_display. (You'll have to do this in
#    each pane in which you want to open a graphical display.)
